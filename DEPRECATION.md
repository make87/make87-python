# Deprecation Notice

## What is deprecated

The `make87` Python SDK is deprecated. This SDK was designed to support the legacy make87 "application SDK integration" workflow for building applications on the make87 platform.

## What to use instead

make87 has pivoted to a **CLI/agent-based device management workflow**. The SDK integration approach is no longer supported.

## Maintenance stance

- **Status:** Deprecated / Unmaintained
- **Updates:** No further updates, bug fixes, or security patches will be released
- **Support:** No support is provided for this package

## Migration guidance

1. **Pin your dependency:** If you must continue using this SDK temporarily, pin to a specific version in your requirements
2. **Plan migration:** Begin planning your migration away from this SDK
3. **Adopt CLI/agent workflow:** Transition to make87's CLI/agent-based device management approach

## Timeline

This package will remain available on PyPI for historical purposes but will receive no further development.
